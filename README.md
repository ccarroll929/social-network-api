## Description: 
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to a friend's thoughts,  and create a friends list.
This API features `MongoDB` (a NoSQL database) with seeded data, `Express.js` for handling API routes, and `Mongoose ODM` to create our User and Thought/Reaction models.
Upon starting the server, we can then use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to make `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests which allow us to view, create, edit, and delete users, thoughts, and reactions. 

In this [walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w18IRo8NiMAN3eMSQqwUz6kttnTFVDMZ/view), I will demonstrate the API's functionality using Insomnia.
